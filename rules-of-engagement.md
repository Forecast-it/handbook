# Rules of engagement

All Forecasters adhere to the following rules of engagement:

1. I'll be passionate about Forecast's mission, about my work. I'll love what we do for companies and employees everywhere.
2. I'll demonstrate respect for the individual. I'll be nice an listen to others, and respect myself. I'll act with integrity and professionalism.
3. I'll do whatever it takes to get the job done, no matter what it takes, but within legal and ethical boundaries.
4. I'll not waste money and I'll question every cost. I know that this is a company and not a charity.
5. I'll present solutions to problems and suggest actionable recommendations.
6. I'll help my colleagues and recognize the team when we win.I'll never let them behind when we lose.
7. I'll constantly improve. I'll approach everyday as an opportunity to do a better job, admitting to and learning from my mistakes.
8. I'll selflessly pursue customer success.
9. I'll support the culture of meritocracy and pay for performance.
10. I'll focus on results and winning. Goals, not just winning yardage.
11. I'll be transparent. I'll communicate, be brutally honest, even when it's difficult, because I trust my colleagues.
12. I'll always pursue and drive customer satisfaction.
13. I'll have fun at work and approach my job with enthusiasm.
14. I'll be a good person to work with -- I'll not be a jerk.
15. I'll never talk negativley and destructively behind someone's back; rather I'll confront them with the issue I'm facing or wanted to comment to others about, to allow us all to have a trusting and hyper-productive collaborative and autonomous environment.
16. I'll acknowledge that we, collectively, have the power to keep an open and honest culture. Be a good person. Be a professional but also as a human.
17. I'll agree to live and follow these values. If my colleagues fail to live up to any of these rules, I'll speak up and will help them correct; in turn, I'll be open to constructive criticism from my colleagues should I fail to live by these values. I understand that my performance will be judged in part by how well I demonstrate these values in my daily work.

Non opus Diligentia, Vis, Celeritas - We work with precision, power, speed. :shipit:
