# Why we're here

## Philosophy

Imagine a world where everyone has full knowledge and makes the optimal business decisions, every minute of every day. A world where everyone knows what to work on and there’s full insight into every project with just one click.  

Imagine what freedom it would bring to operations if there is always optimal use of people, work, and time.

At Forecast, we believe your every day should be filled with less ad-hoc and administrative work. That freedom creates more room to focus on evolving, improving and empowering your people to think innovatively. Whether it is designing, structuring, acting or simply steering the company in the right direction, Forecast has your back.

Increase agility with a platform that embraces a radically new approach of continuous improvement and learning by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). Instead of spending time collecting data, we think you should be spending time acting from data. That will enable you to move from the old world projects first to a new world of clients first, which in turn will help you deliver better results.

## The Forecast vision
