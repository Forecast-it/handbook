# Why we're here - The Forecast manifesto

We created forecast to simplify and automate resource & project management. Profitability and deadlines are important, but there is something even more essential: Creativity and innovation. That’s what makes customers’ tick, and that is what makes their teams happy.

When creativity and innovation take center stage, their resource & project management tool should not. Complexity and cumbersome manual processes kill creativity and innovation. That is why we have taken a radically new approach to resource & project management in digital agencies.

We focus exclusively on the needs of digital agencies, and cut out all features only needed by other types of businesses. We will use this focus not only to make a simple interface, but also to include some powerful features rarely included in traditional resource & project management tools used by digital agencies today.

But we aim higher than just making resource & project management easier. We want to automate it. Our goal is to eliminate all manual processes of resource & project management by using artificial intelligence to setup and manage projects automatically.

Our goal is to build a resource & project management tool that is instantly familiar to a project manager at a digital agency, because all features are designed specifically for him or her. The interface should be simple because it has less features designed to build skyscrapers and rocketships, but more powerful if you are a digital agency because it has features specifically needed by digital agencies. And finally the tool should use AI to eliminate and automate all manual processes.

# The Forecast vision

To eliminate all manual and error-prone project work and ensure that all projects are successful and profitable while bringing delight to both customers and team members.

We want to be the best in the world at what we do by building a world-class product and service. We ask for and act on candid feedback to learn continuously from both our customers and the team. We know there’s always room to improve.

Forecast will be the ultimate [Professional Service Automation (PSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_services_automation) core to run any project-driven organization! :rocket:
