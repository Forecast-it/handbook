# Our internal systems

Besides the customer-facing application Forecast, we have a number of internal systems that help us support, report, and operate the company. They are as follows:

### Hubspot

The CRM and marketing automation system used by the commercial team.

### Slack

We use this for all internal chat communication.

### Github

Where we host all of our code repositories.

### Kibana

Logging of errors for bug fixing, monitoring and troubleshooting the production code.

### Sendgrid

All transactional and newsletters are sent via this service.

### Stripe

All our credit card payments are handled by this service.

### Chartmogul

We use this service to keep track of clients, payments and so on.

### Gsuite

We use the full suite for email, documents and filesharing.

### Zeplin

All our sketch wireframes are uploaded here.

### Invision

Mostly used for sharing designs, moodboards, testing prototypes etc.

### Hotjar

We use this to help troubleshoot things in Forecast that are difficult for our users. For instance if we introduced a new feature, do people then understand how it works. If they do, great! If not, we'll have to take a look at it again in the product team.

### AWS

We use this service hos all our infrastructure.
