# Side jobs - Working 9 to 5 and odd jobs

We're not talking about [Dolly Parton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_to_5_(Dolly_Parton_song)) here. We're talking about working other professional, paid jobs outside of your work at Forecast. It’s not a black and white topic. There are one-time gigs, other pursuits, or opportunities that help you grow and make life interesting. We want to support that. But we want to make sure professional endeavors outside of Forecast don’t create conflicts of interest or affect your time, dedication, or performance at Forecast. So it’s a delicate balance.

With that in mind, here are some examples of what we’d consider OK and what we would consider a conflict of interest and not ok:

## This is in general considered ok, but ask if in doubt!

1. An occasional side gig, free or paid, for someone you know. For example, if you want to work on a friend’s website, or a design or writing project for something you’re involved with, that’s fine.

2. An occasional speaking gig, free or paid. Someone’s going to pay you to give a talk somewhere? That’s fine as long as it doesn’t involve multiple days off for travel (unless you use your own personal vacation time against this travel time).

3. A side business that’s different from your day job, as long as the commitment is only a few hours a week. If you come to work exhausted because you’re trying to start a full-time business on the side, it’s going to impact your performance here.

4. Serve as an advisor for another company, or be on a board, as long as there’s no conflict of interest. The time commitment must be under a few hours a month. And if there’s a scheduling conflict, Forecast gets priority.

5. Do volunteer or occasional pro-bono work for a cause you’re actively involved with. A little work here and there is fine, but, for example, becoming an organization’s full-time web designer and being on the hook to work during your standard work day, etc, would not be OK.

## This is never ok, but you can still ask if in doubt!

1. You can’t work full time or part time for another company in our industry.

2. Go out on a regular speaking circuit tour which is going to require multiple days of travel multiple times a year. That’s too disruptive to our own work schedule and to your fellow Forecasters.

3. Consult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to Forecast, etc).

4. Be aggressive in marketing your availability for side work. If something comes to you through a friend or some connection, fine, but aggressively promoting something on the side will ultimately result in a conflict of interest.

5. Take on anything outside of work that’ll pull attention from work. For example, if you wanted to launch an app, but the app requires providing timely customer support to people who use the app, that’s going to eat into your day here at work. That's just not going to work...

## In general

Here’s a few guiding principles about whether something could be a problem:

* Is it competitive?
* Does it occupy a disproportionate amount of your time?
* Does it require you to be away during times when you’re needed at work?
* Is it another paid gig that employs the same skills Forecast is paying you for?

In general we’d like to be lenient within reason, but we’re going to be strict if we see it impact your time, attention, or performance.

Please ask if in doubt :smile:
