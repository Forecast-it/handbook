# What influenced us to create Forecast

## $1 million USD is wasted every 20 seconds due to poor project management
### Why would we allow this to continue?

**[66% of projects fail](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value)
 and we don’t seem to learn from those failures...**

Mistakes are repeated and current tools don’t help humans make better decisions. Data amounts are increasing exponentially, spreading across disparate systems, making consistency difficult. Data is already there, but lying dormant.

Companies must rely on technology to help retain gained knowledge and use it to improve business performance. :computer:

**A massive project management talent shortage is already here...**

As the vast majority of work becomes project-based, speed is essential. The demand for project-based professionals is fast fueling a worldwide talent gap. By 2027, employers will need to fill nearly 90 million project management related roles.

This means that projects determine the hiring patterns, rather than the other way around. Data is the key to winning.

### A perfect  problem for AI

Leveraging an entire company’s project history for decision making is too complex and tedious for people alone. The solution is not more reporting. 

AI is the only way to solve it.

Our AI uses the customer’s entire dataset across all business systems to help optimize, staff and deliver projects.

Forecast is always-learning and always-improving, guiding individuals, teams and companies to a state of best practice


## Dirty experiences gave us all dirty hands

Hailing from a Computer Science background with years of different industry experiences, epecially within professional services and consulting, all 4 founders had experienced first-hand how projects fail due to poor planning and lack of tools to help keep projects on track (even huge, expensive projects with many hundreds of people working on them). That's when we decided to quit our day jobs and solve this problem once and for all.

Our goal was and still is to this day, to make it possible and even easy, simple and delightful to plan and run everything from small and simple to large and complex projects, in a way that is highly automated and profitable.

We are achieving our goal through a fresh approach where we apply AI and Machine Learning technology to ease the dull, numbing pain of administering projects, people and time. We do this so our customers can spend their time on exciting this, fresh ideas and all the fun stuff. We take pride in having customers from all around the globe to put trust in us helping them run their businesses better and smarter.
