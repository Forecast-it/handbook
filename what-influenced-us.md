# What influenced us to create Forecast

## $1 million USD is wasted every 20 seconds due to poor project management
[66% of projects fail](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value)
 and we don’t seem to learn from those failures... <br />

Mistakes are repeated and current tools don’t help humans make better decisions. Data amounts are increasing exponentially, spreading across disparate systems, making consistency difficult. Data is already there, but lying dormant. <br / >

Companies must rely on technology to help retain gained knowledge and use it to improve business performance. :computer:


### Forging superhuman project organizations...

* **providing unprecedented visibility and control**, over every aspect of the organization's operations and finances, across any system
* **automating all administrative work**, ensuring happy people that deliver value with every task

## Dirty experiences gave us all dirty hands

Coming from a Computer Science background with a few years of different industry experiences, epecially within professional services and consulting, all 4 founders had experienced first-hand how projects fail because of poor planning and lack of tools to help keep projects on track (even huge, expensive projects with many hundreds of people working on them). That's when we decided to quit our day jobs and solve this problem once and for all.

Our goal was and still is to this day, to make it possible and even easy, simple and delightful to plan and run everything from small and simple to large and complex projects, in a way that is accurate, predictable, and profitable.

We are achieving our goal through a fresh approach where we apply AI and Machine Learning technology to ease the dull, numbing pain of administering projects, people and time. We do this so our customers can spend their time on exciting this, fresh ideas and all the fun stuff. We take pride in having customers from all around the globe to put trust in us helping them run their business better and smarter.
