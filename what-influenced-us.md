# What influenced us to create Forecast

## Using AI to solve complex problems 

[66% of projects are failing](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value) and we don’t seem to learn from our mistakes…

The reason being that people tend to do the same mistakes because their current tools are not helping them make better decisions.

Taking advantage of the entire company’s data history and using it for predictions is so complex that AI and ML is the only way to solve it. :computer:

## Dirty experiences gave us all dirty hands

Coming from a Computer Science background with a few years of different industry experiences, epecially within professional services and consulting, all 4 founders had experienced first-hand how projects fail because of poor planning and lack of tools to help keep projects on track (even huge, expensive projects with many hundreds of people working on them). That's when we decided to quit our day jobs and solve this problem once and for all.

Our goal was and still is to this day, to make it possible and even easy, simple and delightful to plan and run everything from small simple projects to large complex projects, in a way that is accurate, predictable, and profitable.

We are achieving our goal through a fresh approach where we apply AI and Machine Learning technology to ease the dull, numbing pain of administering projects, people and time. We do this so our customers can spend their time on exciting this, fresh ideas and all the fun stuff. We take pride in having customers from all around the globe to put trust in us helping them run their business better and smarter.
