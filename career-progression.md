# Career progression

At Forecast team turnover is extremely low. We take great pride in that, and attribute it to having a great place to work, with amazing and talented people and interesting problems to solve. When you work at Forecast, it should be something you think about being a place for making a life-long career.

## Titles

Advancing your career at Forecast means that you continuously challenge yourself to become better at your role itself.
Whether you work in product, design, engineering, customer success, or whatever, you can always become more skilled in your specific area. This is especially important since we're still a relatively small company with an extremely flat and  autonomous hierarchy.

Within each of our job functions, we've mapped our trajectory of mastery to four different role levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here's a list of the full hierarchy:

* Junior [ROLE]
* [ROLE]
* Senior [ROLE]
* Lead [ROLE]

-- Executive level --

* [ROLE] Director
* VP [ROLE]
* C-level

While this is how we recognize mastery, it's by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a C-level. Forecast needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years.

These titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at Forecast. On a daily basis, these titles are not an influencer in your ability to make suggestions or decisions. All voices are equally heard and what their primary purpose is, is to give everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at Forecast.

## Salaries & promotions

Forecast pays competitively depending on the office you're hired into. We pay and promote based on sustained performance and annually give raises based on core price index inflation numbers (not a guarenteed practice).

At your 1:1 you'll have a dialogue with your line manager on the path to the next level and your long term goals. When you get a promotion, that goes from one level to the next, you'll get a corresponding pay raise effective on the next pay cycle.

## Performance feedback

At Forecast we believe in continous feedback. This means that at any point you shouldn't be in doubt about your performance. If you for some unforseen reason are in doubt, then please ask your manager directly!

### Manager 1:1s
You'll meet with your manager for a 1:1 session on their regular cadence (typically weekly or bi-weekly). It's up to each manager to determine how best to approach that meeting, but we ask that whatever process they use, they use the same process for every team member. Managers should have a conversation with you about:
- your daily work content and load
- your overall work satisfaction
- your relationships with your team, manager, and company
- your thoughts about personal growth and how those impact your work at Forecast

This is a two-way street! You should be offering your thoughts on these topics to your manager, and your manager should be giving you feedback about your performance in these areas.
