# Rituals

At Forecast we're not big on meeting but to provide some structure and information transfer we have certain rituals that we gather around. :fire:

## Town halls

Once a month our CEO entertains an all hands town hall, typically lasting just shy of an hour. 
This is where the big presentation of strategy and current performance is done, and the main way for you to keep in the loop with what the company is focused on at a high, digestible level. It's also at town halls anyone can ask questions about anything that involves the entire company.

## Sprints

At Forecast We work in 1-week sprints. These small iterations enable us to change direction at extreme speed. They give us an internal sense of urgency and force us to break things into very small pieces before starting them. Lastly it enables us to split work more evenly between team members and deliver continuously.

The idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller building blocks that can be assembled into a cohesive whole.

On the product level everything is automated so that when a developer merges their code into the testing branch all tests are run automatically and it's deployed to our staging environment. As it passes succesfully through testing we can push code to the live production environment from there instantly.

The general concept of sprints extends to all parts of Forecast. It gives us a regular rhythm and ensures that all parts of the company work in unison and deliver at a regular pace.

## Standups

Itâ€™s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means, so we have a daily morning standup for the individual teams where everyone spends less than 2 minutes explaining what they worked on yesterday, what they'll work on today and if they need help from anyone on things that are causing difficulties.

## Demos

Once a week the product teams have a one hour demo meeting where everyone at Forecast is encouraged to attend. At this meeting the product team members take turns showing what has been built during the previous week and explains everyone what, how and why it was built. 

## Retros

Individual teams have retrospective meeting at their own cadence. At this meeting all team members participate and this is where we reflect on how we're doing, how things are progressing and how we can improve the ways we're working, communicating, making decisions and so on. As always, it's a friendly setting where everyone is allowed to speak freely about anything.

## Regular meetings

Teamwork over meetings. Meetings should be kept to a minimum.

Inviting people to regular meetings is something we try to refrain from. If you're invited to a meeting without a clear agenda or it's not been agreed to beforehand, then you're free to decline. 

Except for the events described above invitations to regular meetings is not something we typically do. If you invite people for a meeting, please have a clear goal and think about all the people's time and company money you're wasting for every minute it's not productive. 

## Meetups

We try to participate in relevant meetups, at these we often give a talk, pitch or sponsor. 

Currently we're driving one meetup together with Valtech called [#DPMCOPE - Digital Project Management CPH](https://www.meetup.com/DPMCOPE/). The other main one we participate in is [#AgilityLab Copenhagen](https://www.meetup.com/agilitylab/) where we act as co-organizer, sometimes hosting, sometimes speaking and sometimes just participating as guests.

At all meetups we encourage Forecasters to go learn interesting new things and participate in the community. All Forecasters are also always welcome to pitch ideas for intersting talks about a relevant topic.

## After hours team events & Friday Fun

Once every 2-3 months we try to do an out-of-office team event for all Forecasters that are interested. Anyone is free to suggest things we can do in the #social-activities slack channel and previously it has been ranging from going to dinner to go-carting or escape rooming. Forecast pays for these events, either partly or in whole. So come on, bring your best ideas! :bike: :doughnut: :tropical_drink:

Friday Fun is a more low-key concept where Forecast donates a fixed amount to one or more people that pool together and feel like hosting an event on Friday afternoon. This can been everything from drinking a simple beer to board-games, console gaming tournaments or quizzes (often involving the theme Hawaii).
