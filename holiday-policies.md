## Questions specific to Denmark
### What happened from 1st May 2020?
-   On May 1st 2020 you received the vacation days that you’d earned from Jan 1st 2019 to August 31st 2019. A max of 16,64 days depending on the number of months you worked with Forecast during the above period. These can be used from May 1st 2020 to August 31st 2020
-   If you don’t use the vacation days between May 1st 2020 and August 31st 2020 they will automatically be transferred to the new vacation law. This means you can use these days until Dec 31st 2021
-   Regarding feriefri-days earned between Jan 2019 to Dec 2019, they need to be held between May 1st 2020 and April 30th 2021. Feriefri-days will continue to be earned in the calendar year
 
### What happens on 1st September 2020?
-   You’ll now accrue holiday - earning 2.08 days of vacation on a monthly basis, instead of having a bank of days at the beginning of the year. With the new system, you’ll be able to spend those days the month after you earn them. So if you earn 2.08 vacation days in January, you can take them in February
-   You'll be able to keep your accrued holiday from September 1st 2020 to December 31st 2021, giving you 16 months to spend your holiday
 
### What happens to my holiday pay during the transition?
-   In the transition year September 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020, you will earn 5 weeks of holiday. This was initially meant to be frozen until you retired or left Denmark
    
-   On 14th June 2020, the government announced that 3 weeks worth of holidays from the above 5, will be paid out in the aftermath of Covid19 to boost the economy
    
-   You can see the current balance of the days earned during the transition period on your payslip under “overgangsperiode dage”. In the below example there are 18,72 days earned so far![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UTpxeMYN9AAPvPMFeqZNMr4ybt8Sz8VePfjPZMnRLX9itHj-lmcZMUKAcQNZeGgMeatFt7gS_PQA4fm1sUv4cdCgQsMoINsMPmUNJiVT-IJCpcF38ORRd5-g_Q4FgxWeqb6K82wP)
    
-   The transition year applies to all employees and your savings are 12.5% of your holiday eligible salary
    
-   After 3 weeks worth of vacation days are paid out, you will be left with 2 weeks that will remain frozen until further notice. You will receive the savings at the retirement age or if you leave Denmark
    
-   There are talks about paying those 2 weeks as well but that decision has not been made by government at the time of writing this FAQ (15th June 2020)
    
-   Use below link to find out the approx amount you could be getting for the 3 weeks payment [https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/penge/dine-indefrosne-feriepenge-er-paa-vej-til-dig-se-hvor-mange-du-faar](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/penge/dine-indefrosne-feriepenge-er-paa-vej-til-dig-se-hvor-mange-du-faar)
  
### What if I haven’t earned any vacation days in 2019?
-   You can apply for vacation advance on borger.dk
    
### How do I book my holiday?
 -   You’ll continue to book your holiday via Forecast and you’ll be able to track your allowance via your payslip under “Ferieregnskab”
