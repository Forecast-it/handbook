# Business Travel Policy
## Policy brief & purpose
Our company travel policy outlines our provisions for company-related travel. We’ll explain which expenses we’ll reimburse and how. We’ll also give instructions to our employees to track their expenses correctly when traveling.
## Scope
This policy applies to all our employees. In this policy, we refer to ‘travel’ meaning a business trip to a different city than the one you’re in. We’re also counting any car, train or bus trip that lasts longer than an hour.
This policy doesn’t refer to traveling to and from the office on a daily basis for work. We reimburse commute expenses based on each employee’s contract or agreement with our company.
### Policy elements
As our employee, you may need to travel for company purposes. This includes trips to:
-   Meet with clients or partners.
    
-   Attend events, like conferences, where you’ll represent our company.
    
-   Visit our company’s offices in other locations.
    
-   Conduct research or give talks/ lectures/ presentations on behalf of our company.
    
For this kind of travel, we’ll reimburse transportation and accommodation expenses, as well as per diem expenses.
## Booking Procedure
1. **Approval** <br />
If you need to travel for any of the above reasons you need to first get a written approval from your manager for the travel.

### Legal / medical expenses
If you need to travel to countries that need a visa or other documentation to enter, we’ll cover all relevant expenses (excluding expenses for issuing passports). The same applies to medical expenses, like medical insurance for travelers, vaccinations or examinations. We’ll pay all these costs directly, you won’t need to do anything.
Medical care fees due to travel-related accidents may be covered by workers’ compensation insurance. If not, we may partially or fully reimburse you for your medical expenses.

#### Local transportation
Public Transport: When arrived at your destination, we encourage you to take public transportation where available, convenient and safe. If you use public transport, buy a ticket (either one-way or multiple-days if applicable) and submit the receipt to our expenses software. You can take taxis to move around the area for business purposes. Always ask for receipts and we’ll reimburse fares for traveling:
-   From airport / stations to your hotel and back.
    
-   To and from every place you go for company purposes (like conference halls, lunches with clients or client offices).
    
-   Cabs or rideshares
    
We won’t reimburse transportation expenses without receipts or for trips to museums or other places for personal purposes.
### Accommodation
When traveling for company purposes, Forecast will provide recommended hotels for you to stay in London and Copenhagen. If no rooms are available at recommended hotels you’re entitled to stay at an equivalent hotel in the area. You should book your room through our TravelPerk or direct link if available. If you plan to stay longer for personal reasons, you’ll need to pay for the additional stay yourself.
Wakeup Copenhagen: Recommended hotel in CPH with company discount. Use the following link for reservations [https://www.wakeupcopenhagen.dk/?corpLogin=1#/](https://www.wakeupcopenhagen.dk/?corpLogin=1#/)
We won’t reimburse any extra room-related charges incurred. We may make an exception if you need to upgrade your room for reasons outside of your control (for example, a malfunction that makes your room unsuitable and there’s no room of equal cost available). In this case, you should contact our Director of Finance or Chief of Staff immediately so that they find the best solution and arrange the payment.
If you want to stay at a more expensive lodging for a particular reason (like to be closer to family who lives close by), you’ll need to pay the difference yourself.
### Traveling with a non-employee
Our policy allows you to share a company-booked room with a partner, friend or family member who wants to travel with you, as long as this doesn’t incur extra charges for our company. For example, if we’ve already booked a room for you that has enough space, you can host your partner, friend or family member. Keep in mind that you’ll be financially responsible for any expenses or damages this person incurs.
We won’t reimburse any expenses for your co-traveler for the entirety of the trip. The only exception is taxi fares which don’t depend on the number of people on the ride.
### Expenses while on a trip
For business trips exceeding 24-hours, you’re entitled to per diems to cover the cost of meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) as well as petty acquisitions (coffee, metro/bus ticket). The per diem rate is $80. In case lunch and/or dinner is provided the per diem is reduced by 30% per meal, if breakfast is provided the per diem is reduced by 15%. To claim your per diem you must send a mail to accounting@forecast.app.
When it comes to meetings with clients (like dinners) or team outings, these must be approved by the team manager and cost must be covered by the team budget.
Other expenses included are airport and hotel parking fees.
## What you need to do
We ask you to use your best judgment when traveling for company purposes and to follow the guidelines. Don’t go overboard with spending and always ask for receipts and keep them organized.
When you’re back from your trip, submit all expenses through expensify or by sending them to the accounting team at accounting@forecast.app within two months. This includes documentation of the trip to claim your per diem, please include if any meals were provided. If you had a reason not to submit expenses within that period, talk to your manager. They’ll be the ones to approve your expenses for reimbursement. You’ll receive the money within a week after your manager approves.
