# Forecast values

All Forecasters are hired based on living up to our 3 cores values:

## 1. Direct and honest
We speak up and listen, driven by our Danish roots. We share our opinions directly and honestly with each other, and welcome healthy disagreement. We weigh an argument by the quality of the idea not stars on your shoulder. When a decision is made, we stand behind and commit to it, even if we argued for an alternative.

## 2. Passionate and proud 
We are a unique and diverse team, all united in our passion to help everyone do the very best work of their lives - by letting technology do what it does best, so people can do what they do best. We value simplicity and are proud of our personal contribution and dedication to changing the world; one project at a time.

## 3. Oomph
We are a kick-ass and caring bunch of people with a can-do attitude, driving us to solve problems. We push ourselves to constantly learn and evolve, knowing that the pursuit to be the best is an ongoing journey. We love having fun while building the most advanced technology in our industry.



Non opus Diligentia, Vis, Celeritas - We work with precision, power, speed. :shipit:
