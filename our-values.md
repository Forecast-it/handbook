# Forecast values

All Forecasters are hired based on living up to our 3 cores values:

## 1. Passionate and proud 
| All of humanity’s most significant endeavours are delivered as projects and we are obsessed about making them and our customers successful. We are proud of our personal contribution to changing the world; one project at a time.

It's this dedication that drives us to build the world’s best product that forges superhuman project organizations by augmenting people to make better-than-human decisions.

## 2. Direct and honest
We share our opinions directly and honestly across the organisation, and welcome healthy conflict. The weight of your argument comes by the quality of your ideas not the stars on your shoulders. After a decision, we stand behind and commit to it, even if we argued for an alternative.

It’s this candor that propels sound decisions for solving customer problems on a global scale, leaving politics sulking at the door.

## 3. Oomph
We are ambitious, energetic and driven. Enthusiastic individuals that seize the initiative and have fun, in a collaborative and diverse setting. We like noodles but don’t hire them.

It’s this raw energy, power and accelerant we use to continuously improve and drive Forecast forward at lightning speed.
