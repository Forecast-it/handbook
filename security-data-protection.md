## Your responsibilities on data protection
Every Forecaster has a personal responsibility to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act and the Forecast Technologies Data Protection policy. It is the responsibility of every Forecaster to protect any personal data that they hold or are responsible for on behalf of the Company and to uphold the legal requirements placed on the Company for Data Protection. 

Any employee who is found to have revealed or disclosed any personal data to any unauthorised person or organisation will be in breach of Company policy and will be subject to disciplinary action, which may, dependent on the nature of the disclosure be regarded as Gross Misconduct. Such disclosure may also be treated as a criminal offence.

You are entitled to access information that the Company has collected and retained on your employment record and file. This could include information regarding any grievances or disciplinary action, or information obtained through monitoring processes. Should you wish to access this information, please talk to your line manager.
