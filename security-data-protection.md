# Security & data protection

Security and data protection is extremely important to Forecast. We need to make sure we safeguard both our internal data, but in particular also our client data.

This is why we're fully compliant and adhering to the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). To live up to this we must ensure that we have both internal controls and processes to ensure data is kept secure at all times as well as infrastructure and 3rd party systems that support security at the core.

Please follow these links to see more details on how we protect our client data:

## Security guidelines

All Forecasters must adhere to the following guidelines to ensure privacy and data protection is compliant:

1. Always screen lock your computer before you leave it unattended, also when you just leave it just for a few minutes.
2. Always enable 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) on all 3rd party services (if they support it).
3. Do not share your passwords with other people, including other Forecasters.
4. When sharing files, please make sure they can be seen by the intended recipient only (use puclic sharing with caution).
5. Make sure that outside people in the office have offical business and a Forecast chaperone.
6. If you're the last one to leave the office, make sure that the alarm and video surveillance has been activated.
