# How we work

If you need constant management, this isn’t a place for you. We value a self-starting and action-oriented attitude in the people we hire. That means all Forecasters are strong self-starters who are able set goals and get others excited about them, define the plan to reach them, find the needed resources, and execute.

We expect everyone to understand the broader context, prioritize, and take action to get us closer to the company-wide vision. Your team and team lead will always support you and help you learn, but don’t expect someone to lead you by the hand and tell you what to do

We're not fans of office politics or optimizing for your own success at the expense of others. That's why we only hire people who are motivated to help others around them succeed. 

## We're here to scale globally

We’ve got off to a great start, but we’re still at the beginning of reaching our vision. We’re all extremely motivated by the huge amount of things we’ll build and improve together in the coming years.
Since day one, we’ve focused on building a good foundation for scaling: we have a healthy company culture and a stellar team that’s driven to constantly exceed expectations in building the best product and service to delight our customers. 

Our product is built on a sustainable infrastructure that allows us to develop new features and functionalities fast. Our world-class customer support gives us competitive edge in the market. Our ambition is that the vast majority of our customers, small and large, will have a natural wish to recommend us to their peers, and that they’re eager to continuously build a better product and service closely together with us.

But that’s just an early start. Over the next years, we’ll have to learn to do things we haven’t done before. Luckily, we’re better equipped than ever before to grow and scale Forecast.

## Commanders intent

Everything at Forecast works using a term called [Commanders Intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)#Commander's_intent) which roughly translates to "How we all can pull in the same direction with full autonomy". 

Commander's intent is taken from and plays a central role in military decision making and planning. It acts as a basis for Forecasters to develop their own plans and orders to transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commander.

## Townhalls

Once a month our CEO entertains an all hands townhall, typically lasting just shy of an hour. 
This is where the big presentation of strategy and current performance is done, and the main way for you to keep in the loop with what the company is focused on at a high, digestible level. 

## Sprints

At Forecast We work in 1-week sprints. These small iterations enable us to change direction at extreme speed. They give us an internal sense of urgency and force us to break things into very small pieces before starting them. Lastly it enables us to split work more evenly between team members and deliver continuously.

The idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller building blocks that can be assembled into a cohesive whole.

On the product level everything is automated so that when a developer merges their code into the testing branch all tests are run automatically and it's deployed to our staging environment. As it passes succesfully though that we can push code to the live production environment instantly.

The general concept of sprints extends to all parts of Forecast. It gives us a regular rhythm and ensures that all parts of the company work in unison and deliver at a regular pace.

## Standups

It’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means so we have a daily morning standup for the entire company where everyone spends less than 2 minutes explaining what they worked on yesterday, what they'll work on today and if they need help from anyone on things that are causing difficulties.

## Demos

Once a week the product teams have a one hour demo meeting where everyone at Forecast is encouraged to attend. At this meeting the product team members take turns showing what has been built during the previous week and explains everyone what, how and why it was built.

## Retros

Once a month we have a retrospective meeting for about one hour. At this meeting all Forecasters participate and this is where we reflect on how we're doing, how things are progressing and how we can improve the ways we're working, communicating, making decisions and so on. As always, it's a friendly setting where everyone is allowed to speak freely about anything.

## Regular meetings

Inviting people to regular meetings is something we try to refrain from. If you're invited to a meeting without a clear agenda or it's not been agreed to beforehand, then you're free to decline. 

Except for the events described above invitations to regular meetings is not something we typically do. If you invite people for a meeting, please have a clear goal and think about all the people's time and company money you're wasting for every minute it's not productive. 

## Self-organizing, independent teams called chapters

Many books have been written about organizational structures. We seek to efficient and lean in our approach, meaning that we keep a very flat structure. This means a single chapter should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible. This is where we try to emulate a living organism that is fully self-sustaining and capable of making autonumous decisions.

### Chaplains

A chaplain is the single person resonsible for driving a chapter. A chapter is a small cross-functional self-organized team with less than 10 people. They have end-to-end responsibilities and they work together towards their long-term mission. In chapters the key drive is autonomy.

### Product chapters

A product chapter is run by a single chaplain and then consists of people from design + experience, full stack devs. that also do functionality testing and data science that take care of our machine learning capabilities. This ensures that we have teams that can go all the way from initial idea or concept to a fully deployed feature in Forecast. Combined with our automated testing and deployment process we can thus ensure that we have decoupled releases.

### Commercial chapters

A commercial chapter is also run by a chaplain and then consists of people from marketing, sales and customer success. This ensures that we have teams that can take a sales play all the way from initial idea to a fully supported an onboarded new Forecast customer.

## Working from home vs. being in the office

Our working hours are very flexible, but to have great team cohesion we encourage most people to be in the physical Copenhagen office at least 4 days a week. This has two clear benefits; one that questions are easily resolved and two that fewer balls are dropped and thus our velocity can be maintained at a continuously high pace. At Forecast we value the balance of speed, power and precision.

## Pitching new ideas

Whether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is to pitch your idea to a few of your fellow Forecasters. If they like it and it doesn't have an impact on the product or commercial roadmap, then go, go, go for it! 

If it has an impact because it requires design, development or other Forecasters involvement you just write down the idea in a card and put it in for analysis. The product team will then pick it up and decide if it's something we should build and when we can fit it into our roadmap.

### Prioritizing new ideas

New ideas in Forecast is always prioritized taking the following things into account:

1. Focus must be on our ideal customer.
2. We’re targeting business users (CxO, PM, TM).
3. The underlying customer teams must though also love the product.
4. Everything must be prioritized according to ease of implementation and impact!
