# How we work
If you need constant management, this isn’t a place for you. We value a self-starting and action-oriented attitude in the people we hire. That means all Forecasters are strong self-starters who are able set goals and get others excited about them, define the plan to reach them, find the needed resources, and execute.

We expect everyone to understand the broader context, prioritize, and take action to get us closer to the company-wide vision. Your team and team lead will always support you and help you learn, but don’t expect someone to lead you by the hand and tell you what to do

We're not fans of office politics or optimizing for your own success at the expense of others. That's why we only hire people who are motivated to help others around them succeed. 

## We're here to scale globally
We’ve got off to a great start, but we’re still at the beginning of reaching our vision. We’re all extremely motivated by the huge amount of things we’ll build and improve together in the coming years.
Since day one, we’ve focused on building a good foundation for scaling: we have a healthy company culture and a stellar team that’s driven to constantly exceed expectations in building the best product and service to delight our customers. 

Our product is built on a sustainable infrastructure that allows us to develop new features and functionalities fast. Our world-class customer support gives us competitive edge in the market. Our ambition is that the vast majority of our customers, small and large, will have a natural wish to recommend us to their peers, and that they’re eager to continuously build a better product and service closely together with us.

But that’s just an early start. Over the next years, we’ll have to learn to do things we haven’t done before. Luckily, we’re better equipped than ever before to grow and scale Forecast.

## Townhalls

Once a month  TODO
This is where the big presentation of strategy and current performance is done, and the main way for you to keep in the loop with what the company is focused on at a high, digestible level. 

## Sprints

At Forecast We work in 1-week sprints. These small iterations enable us to change direction at extreme speed. They give us an internal sense of urgency and force us to break things into very small pieces before starting them. Lastly it enables us to split work more evenly between team members and deliver continuously.

The idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller building blocks that can be assembled into a cohesive whole.

On the product level everything is automated so that when a developer merges their code into the testing branch all tests are run automatically and it's deployed to our staging environment. As it passes succesfully though that we can push code to the live production environment instantly.

The general concept of sprints extends to all parts of Forecast. It gives us a regular rhythm and ensures that all parts of the company work in unison and deliver at a regular pace.

## Standups

It’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means so we have a daily morning standup for the entire company where everyone spends less than 2 minutes explaining what they worked on yesterday, what they'll work on today and if they need help from anyone on things that are causing difficulties.

## Demos

Once a week the product teams have a one hour demo meeting where everyone at Forecast is encouraged to attend. At this meeting the product team members take turns showing what has been built during the previous week and explains everyone what, how and why it was built.

## Retros

Once a month we have a retrospective meeting for about one hour. At this meeting all Forecasters participate and this is where we reflect on how we're doing, how things are progressing and how we can improve the ways we're working, communicating, making decisions and so on. As always, it's a friendly setting where everyone is allowed to speak freely about anything.

## Pitching new ideas

Whether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is to pitch your idea to a few of your fellow Forecasters. If they like it and it doesn't have an impact on the product or commercial roadmap, then go, go, go for it! 

If it has an impact because it requires design, development or other Forecasters involvement you just write down the idea in a card and put it in for analysis. The product team will then pick it up and decide if it's something we should do and when we can do it.

TODO
While a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next cycle, it's more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. We're always working from a backlog of ideas and we have just a few things we can do every cycle, so chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don't be discouraged by this. We've had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening.

## TODO In self-sufficient, independent teams

Organizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible.

Thus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.

For example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn’t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation.

Similarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly.

When we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don’t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.

None of this means we can’t talk together or ask experts with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn’t be a required, necessary step to make Basecamp better.

As soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for “the mobile integration”, we’re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. That’s a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.
