# Forecast employee handbook

On behalf of everyone, I welcome you as a new [Forecaster](https://www.forecast.app/) to Forecast Technologies and wish you every success here.

Forecast is a company that thrives on innovation, collaboration and customer happiness. A company with no silos or towers of knowledge. Where the team is a cohesive whole that functions like a constantly evolving, living organism. We believe that each employee contributes directly to the Company’s growth and success, and we hope you will take pride in being a member of our team.

This is where we share what’s worth knowing about Forecast the company, our culture, our process, expectations, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about when they say “check Mission Control”, what Friday Fun is, why we use so many movie quotes, and hopefully everything in-between.

Ohh, and if you're looking for information on fringe benefits or how to set up your workstation or where to find source code, this book isn’t it.

Making the best company helps us make the best product which is a guiding principle. As with everything here please do help keep these pages up to date! And by up to date, we're not just talking about misspellings and team changes. As each of us are part of this everchanging entity, this handbook should reflect real-world descriptions of how we work and operate.

Forecasters should familiarize themselves with the contents of the employee handbook as soon as possible for it will answer many questions about employment with us.

If you’re reading this just after joining as a Forecaster, it’s particularly on you. Us old timers can't spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things. 

This handbook is a fearless adventure in knowing what to do when no one’s there telling you what to do... :princess:

We hope that your experience here will be challenging, enjoyable, and rewarding. Again, welcome!

Sincerely


Dennis Kayser – CEO
