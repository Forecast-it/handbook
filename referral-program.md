# Employee referral program
At Forecast it's super duper important to get and retain the best talent. As we put a lot of trust in all Forecasters we strongly believe that they also surround themselves with likeminded and talented people.

That's why we have an employee referral program, and this program policy applies to every Forecaster who refers a candidate to our company. We want to make this process as smooth as possible for our employees and those who they refer.

## What is an employee referral bonus?

An employee referral bonus is a financial award that Forecast will pay to an employee for successfully referring a new full time employee into the company. A successful referral is an employee who has completed and passed their probationary period.

If we hire your referral and they complete their probationary period successfully, the payment would be:

| Location of referrer (existing employee) | Referral bonus |
| --- | --- |
| Denmark | 6,200 DKK |
| United Kingdom | 750 GBP |

*Note that the referral bonus will be subject to local tax 

## Who can participate in our employee referral program?

All Forecasters including full time and part time are eligible to refer talent into Forecast. 

The exceptions to this are:
* Hiring managers referring for their own open positions
* Director and above level employees
* Recruiters

## When will I be paid the bonus?
The bonus will be paid out in the next available payroll from when the referee completed their probationary period successfully. You must be employed with Forecast at the time the bonus is due to receive it.

## Who can be referred?
Your referral must not have already applied to Forecast in the six months preceding your referral or have already previously interviewed or been employed at Forecast. Your referral must also be for a permanent full-time position - not a contractor or consultant. 

## How do I submit a referral?
Please submit your referral to our [Careers site](hire.eu.lever) where you can directly add your referral, choosing what open role is most appropriate.
